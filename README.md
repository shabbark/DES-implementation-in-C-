# DES-implementation-in-C-
This C++ project implements a 2-round DES encryption. It converts an 8-letter plaintext and 8-letter key into 64-bit binary, applies parity drop, and generates 48-bit round keys. The plaintext undergoes P-Box expansion, XOR, S-Box compression, and Feistel transformations. After two rounds, the final ciphertext is produced.
